# UtilitiesCostsTracking
 
The aim of this small project is to record the municipality's electricity, gas and utility consumption data, including water consumption, in a database.
As the billing data is not aligned on regular dates, the periods are difficult to compare.
The script calculates costs per day and extrapolates to display monthly costs based on the number of days in the month in the billing period, so whether you have 3 bills in a month or one bill per quarter, the costs will be spread evenly to display a graph representative of consumption (assuming consumption is evenly spread over the billing period).
